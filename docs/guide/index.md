# Quickstart

Cap is a modern, lightweight, and self-hosted CAPTCHA alternative using SHA-256 proof-of-work and instrumentation challenges.

Unlike traditional CAPTCHAs, Cap is fast and unobtrusive, has no telemetry or tracking, and uses accessible proof-of-work instead of annoying visual puzzles.

We've found that Cap offers a better balance for site admins than big-tech alternatives because **it puts the levers of control in your hands, not a third party.** You decide the difficulty, you own the data, and you never pay per-request fees.

Cap consists of a client-side widget, which solves challenges and displays the checkbox, and a server-side component, which generates challenges and redeems solutions.

<Demo />

## 1. Setting up your server

We recommend starting with Cap Standalone for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). It supports multiple site keys and is compatible with reCAPTCHA's siteverify API, so you can even run it alongside reCAPTCHA and switch over gradually.

Start by creating a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  cap:
    image: tiago2/cap:latest
    container_name: cap
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      ADMIN_KEY: your_secret_password
      REDIS_URL: redis://valkey:6379
    depends_on:
      valkey:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped

  valkey:
    image: valkey/valkey:8-alpine
    container_name: cap-valkey
    volumes:
      - valkey-data:/data
    command: valkey-server --save 60 1 --loglevel warning --maxmemory-policy noeviction
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "valkey-cli", "ping"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 5
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  valkey-data:
```

::: tip Tips

- `ADMIN_KEY` is your dashboard login. We recommend making it at least 32 characters.
- Change `3000:3000` if that port is already in use on your host.
- If the dashboard is unreachable, try adding `network_mode: "host"` under the `cap` service.

:::

Start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or your server's IP/domain on port 3000) to access the dashboard. Log in with your admin key, create a site key, and note down both the **site key** and its **secret key** - you'll need both.

We also highly recommend keeping [instrumentation challenges](./instrumentation.md) on. It's already the default and results in much better bot protection.

## 2. Adding the widget

You can find example snippets for multiple frameworks on the [widget docs](./widget.md#usage). We're gonna assume a basic vanilla implementation here for simplicity.

Add the widget script to your website's HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cap.js/widget"></script>
<!-- we recommend pinning a version in production -->
```

Then add the widget component, pointing it at your instance:

```html
<cap-widget data-cap-api-endpoint="https://<your-instance>/<site-key>/"></cap-widget>
```

- `<your-instance>` — the public URL of your Cap Standalone instance (e.g. `cap.example.com`). This must be publicly reachable by the client (not `localhost`).
- `<site-key>` — the site key from your dashboard

Example:

```html
<cap-widget data-cap-api-endpoint="https://cap.example.com/d9256640cb53/"></cap-widget>
```

In your JavaScript, listen for the `solve` event to capture the token:

```js
const widget = document.querySelector("cap-widget");
widget.addEventListener("solve", function (e) {
  const token = e.detail.token;
  // Handle the token as needed
});
```

Alternatively, you can wrap the widget in a `<form></form>` and Cap will automatically submit the token alongside other form data as `cap-token`.

You can also get a token programmatically without displaying the widget by using the [programmatic mode](./programmatic.md).

## 3. Verifying tokens

Once a user completes the CAPTCHA, your backend must verify the token before proceeding. Send a `POST` request to your instance's `/siteverify` endpoint:

::: code-group

```sh [curl]
curl "https://<your-instance>/<site-key>/siteverify" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "secret": "<key_secret>", "response": "<captcha_token>" }'
```

```js [fetch]
const { success } = await (
  await fetch("https://<your-instance>/<site-key>/siteverify", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ secret: "<key_secret>", response: "<captcha_token>" }),
  })
).json();
```

```py [python]
import requests
success = requests.post(
  "https://<your-instance>/<site-key>/siteverify",
  json={"secret": "<key_secret>", "response": "<captcha_token>"}
).json().get("success")

print(success)
```

```php [php]
<?php
$data = json_decode(file_get_contents("https://<your-instance>/<site-key>/siteverify",
  false, stream_context_create([
    "http" => [
      "method" => "POST",
      "header" => "Content-Type: application/json",
      "content" => json_encode(["secret"=>"<key_secret>","response"=>"<captcha_token>"])
    ]
  ])
), true);
var_dump($data['success'] ?? false);
```

:::

- `<key_secret>` — the secret key from your dashboard (**not** the dashboard admin key).
- `<captcha_token>` — the token generated by the widget

A successful verification returns:

```json
{ "success": true }
```

That's it! Cap is fully set up. Your users solve challenges client-side, your server verifies tokens, and you own all the data.

## Next steps

**You're mostly done.** If you'd like, you can:

- [Customize your widget](./widget#options)'s look and feel
- [Fully configure Cap Standalone](./standalone/options.html) to set up CORS or make sure rate-limiting works properly
