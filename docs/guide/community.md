# Community libraries

Want to use Cap without the standalone server and with a different language? Here are some community-maintained libraries that might help. If you want to add a library, feel free to open a pull request!

**Note:** These libraries frequently do **not** support new features such as seeded challenges or instrumentation challenges.

## Widgets

These are wrappers around Cap's widget. They're usually not required as the default widget should work everywhere but can result in a better development experience.
